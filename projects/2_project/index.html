<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Project Abstract: Living in a world that promotes individualism, young adults see other cities in direct competition with their own communities. While it is true that Chester and Philadelphia have their own unique set of environmental injustices, systems of oppression that directly impact both cities benefit from an environmental justice movement that is weakened by division. Young adults surveyed by Good Energy Collaborative (GEC) partners including Chester Residents Concerned for Quality Living (CRCQL) and Re- Entry Community Farm overwhelmingly expressed their desire for educational spaces that expanded their exposure to new opportunities to participate in their communities. This is why the Chester Philadelphia Young Adult Alliance is essential. Focusing on young adult coalition building will agitate the individualism riddled in cities, rehumanize other communities and thus nurture a stronger collective of environmental justice activism in the current moment and beyond. Young adults from marginalized communities in the cities of Philadelphia and Chester face a host of educational challenges that limit their opportunities to thrive. Both cities are faced with lack of programming and workforce development opportunities with a stark absence of programs such as restorative and environmental justice education, which would provide young adults with the skills and tools to address problems that disproportionately affect low-income, BIPOC communities: harmful pollution from toxic facilities, food insecurity, and the school to prison pipeline. Our project aims to support our GEC partners to meet these needs by collaborating directly with young adults in Chester and Philadelphia to jointly design and build educational curricula and infrastructure focused on restorative and environmental justice, amplifying the young adult programming underway by the GEC’s broader ever growing list of community partners (Chester Eastside, CHOICES, the Chester Education Foundation, Philly Service Announcement/the Healing Station, Philly Thrive, Chester Upland Youth Soccer, and Chester Youth Development United). To achieve this goal, our project will establish collaborative student working groups for Chester and Philadelphia where Swarthmore students in the GEC can support the creation of education curricula and lead young adult engagement events. Building from the powerful legacies of Serenity Soular, the Chester Road Collaborative, and the Good Energy Collaborative, this project built in collaboration with young adults for young adults has the potential to become a lasting force for cross-community solidarity, restorative justice, and building thriving futures across the two cities.</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>---
