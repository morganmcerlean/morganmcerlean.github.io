This website is a work in progress! Thank you for your patience.

Currently I am a junior at Swarthmore College and following graduation I plan to pursue a PhD in Human-Computer Interaction. My specific interests lie in human-centered approaches to computing, examining technological and algorithmic practices in relation to their social implications. Mitigating, preventing, and developing community-based, actionable solutions to technologically mediated harms is at the center of my research process. Expanding and supporting restorative, transformative, and environmental justice practices and theory is essential to my research as well.

Taking on projects which reinforce these ambitions is my primary goal in my pursuit of research. As I prepare for a PhD program, I hope to continue working on research that abides by these goals. In my thesis, I hope to work with restorative justice activists and deploy a participatory action methodology to address AI-mediated harms likely to directly affect returning community members. My prior work has included informing people on AI and its ethical implications through an open source educational resource and creating a taxonomy of deepfake harms.
