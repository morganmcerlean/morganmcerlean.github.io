This open-source project contains both Python libraries and computational essays (Jupyter notebooks) that together are designed to allow a diverse audience with little or no background in AI to interact with a variety of AI tools, exploring in more depth how they function, visualizing their outcomes, and gaining a better understanding of their ethical implications. These notebooks have been piloted at multiple institutions in a variety of humanities courses centered on the theme of responsible AI. In addition, we conducted usability testing of AITK. Our pilot studies and usability testing results indicate that AITK is easy to navigate and effective at helping users gain a better understanding of AI. Our goal, in this time of rapid innovations in AI, is for AITK to provide an accessible resource for faculty from any discipline looking to incorporate AI topics into their courses and for anyone eager to learn more about AI on their own."}],"skills":[],"languages":[{"language":"English","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"German","fluency":"Proficient","icon":""}],"interests":[{"name":"Human-Computer Interaction","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["Social Computing","Feminist HCI","Social Justice","Restorative Justice","Environmental Justice","Transformative Justice"]}],"projects":[{"name":"Restorative Justice Activists and AI-Harms (Proposed Thesis)","highlights":["participatory action and design","community-based","AI bias"]},{"name":"Grant Proposal: Chester-Philadelphia Young Adult Alliance (submitted)","highlights":["justice","education","grant co-lead","value of $25K"]}]}
